## First steps

Welcome! Click on the appropriate link below. If nothing seems to apply,
join us on our developers' server at https://chat.zulip.org, and tell us
what's up!

I am interested in

* **Contributing code**. The Zulip server is written in Python, and uses the
  Django framework. We have a React Native mobile app, an Electron desktop
  app, and a jQuery web frontend. We have hundreds of
  [good first issues][good-first-issue] for new programmers of every age and
  ability. Check out our
  [guide for new contributors](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/CONTRIBUTING.md).

[good-first-issue]: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22

* **Contributing non-code**. Zulip has partial translations in dozens of
  languages, thousands of lines of documentation that need review, a backlog
  of unwritten press releases, and much more. A good first stop is the
  [guide for new contributors](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/CONTRIBUTING.md).
  Consider checking out the code contribution sections anyway while you're
  there; you may surprise yourself!

* **Contributing twenty minutes of my time**. Write a review in the app
  store, upvote Zulip on websites, follow Zulip on twitter, and more. These
  actions may seem small but make a big difference in the public perception
  of large projects like Zulip. Our
  [guide to upvoting Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  would be a great article to peruse.

* **Applying for a Zulip internship**. Zulip runs formal internship programs
  with Outreachy, Google Summer of Code, and the MIT Externship program, and
  also has summer and winter internship programs. The Zulip summer and
  winter programs are open to everyone, regardless of age and formal
  experience. This page is also relevant for Google Code-In students.
  [Start here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/CONTRIBUTING.md).

* **Setting up a Zulip server**. Setting up a server takes minutes. Our
  developers' server has thousands of users with hundreds of weekly actives,
  and runs without trouble on a single 8GB machine.  Zulip in production
  supports Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty. The installation
  process is
  [documented here](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod.html).
  Commercial support is available; see https://zulipchat.com/plans for
  details.

* **Using Zulip without setting up a server**. https://zulipchat.com offers
  free and commercial hosting.

* **Checking Zulip out**. The best way to see Zulip in action is to drop by
  our active developers' server at https://chat.zulip.org. We also recommend
  [Zulip for open source](https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source/),
  [Zulip for companies](https://zulipchat.com/for/companies/), and
  [Zulip for working groups and part time communities](https://zulipchat.com/for/working-groups-and-communities/).

* **Talking to X**. Talking to Zulip experts, talking to other users, or
  talking to awesome developers, we all hang out at
  https://chat.zulip.org. Make an account and say hi!
