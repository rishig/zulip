<h1>About Zulip</h1>

<p>
  This server is an installation of
  the <a href="http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zulip open
  source group chat software</a>.  Written in Python and using the
  Django web framework, Zulip has an extensive real-time messaging
  featureset, including both group and private messaging, conversation
  streams, powerful search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image
  previews, audible notifications, missed-message emails, markdown
  formatting, desktop and mobile apps, dozens of integrations, and
  much much more.
</p>

<p>
  Zulip was designed from the ground up to optimize the producitivy of
  discussions and real-time decision-making.  A key feature that
  drives this is Zulip's unique threading model and system for
  tracking unread messages, which make it natural to have multiple
  conversations in the same stream.  As a result, Zulip is far more
  efficient than any other chat product for catching up on
  conversations while you were away from your devices: you can read
  exactly the threads you missed that are important to you, and it
  feels natural to follow up to conversations that happened while you
  were away.
</p>

<p>
  Zulip's vision is to create the world's best group chat software,
  completely open source, so that everyone has the freedom to
  customize, improve, and run their own copy of this essential piece
  of collaboration infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  Further information on the Zulip project and its features can be
  found on the <a href="https://www.zulip.org">Zulip open source
  project's website</a>.

<h2>{% trans %}Zulip history{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>
  Zulip was originally developed by Zulip, Inc., a small startup in
  Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Zulip, Inc. was founded by the MIT team
  that previously created
  the <a href="https://www.ksplice.com">Ksplice</a> powerful software
  for updating a running Linux kernel without rebooting.  Zulip was
  inspired by the <a href="https://barnowl.mit.edu/">Barnowl</a>
  client for
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(protocol)">Zephyr</a>
  protocol, and the incredible community that Zephyr supported at MIT.
</p>

<p>
  Zulip, Inc. was acquired by Dropbox in early 2014, while the product
  was still only available in private beta.  Dropbox eventually
  decided not to invest in the product.  Zulip's beta
  users <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/90-zulip-supporting-oss-at-the-recurse-center">loved
  Zulip's unique user experience</a> and continued enthusiastically
  using Zulip, despite the fact that Zulip was not being actively
  developed.  Eventually, Dropbox decided to release Zulip as open
  source software so that Zulip's fanatical users could continue
  enjoying the software.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, the first time the public had the opportunity to use
  Zulip was when Dropbox
  <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/open-sourcing-zulip-a-dropbox-hack-week-project/">released
  Zulip as open source software</a> in late 2015.  Because of Zulip's
  powerful threading model and complete featureset, the Zulip open
  sourcing announcement was very popular, staying at the top of
  both <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10279961">Hacker
  News</a>
  and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3me9qp/dropbox_has_open_sourced_zulip_group_chat_software/">the
    programming subreddit</a> for an entire day.
</p>

<p>
  Zulip was open sourced with the complete version control history
  intact because 10 Zulip users visited Dropbox for a full week to
  help with the technical work required to open source Zulip well.
  The Zulip community is incredibly grateful to both Dropbox and those
  enthusiastic early users of Zulip for making the Zulip open source
  project possible.
</p>

<p>
  By the end of 2015, Zulip was already going strong with a community
  of dozens of developers around the world.  As of
  mid-2016, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(protocol)">more
  than 150 people from all over the world</a> have contributed who
  have
  contributed <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pulls">almost
  1000 improvements</a> to the software, and the Zulip project is
  moving faster than when Zulip, Inc. had 11 full-time employees
  working on the Zulip software.
